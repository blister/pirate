pirate! Changelog

0.2.5 07 August 2006

[FIXES]

[ADDITIONS]
	- Added two Pirate Notifications to Pirate.Ship for Ship.Load and
	Ship.Complete
	- Added the custom pirate! event system (Pirate.Watch && Pirate.Notify)

[NOTES]
	- I still want to improve the Notification/Watch system. I think that
	a custom event system can add a lot of power and flexibility to
	pirate! and I want to play with it a lot more when I get a chance.

	- IMPORTANT: I removed all of the global function handles that
	pirate.js was providing. The only one that still exists is Try because
	I don't want to have to hack a bunch of other code. Just know that
	they're gone. I think that in the future, only Ships should do
	anything to the global scope.

	- I stopped using the crazy named versioning that I had been trying
	out. I like the idea, but it got to be too confusing, even for me, so
	I can only imagine how everyone else was feeling. I think it's a good
	idea and may still have some sort of application in the CS world, but
	not really in this project. I gave it a shot.
