# pirate! (0.2.5)
a Library by Eric Ryan Harrison

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
1. Download the library.
2. Unzip the library.
3. Open up pirate.js and modify the locational information to reflect 
the libraries path on your webserver.
```js
var Pirate = {
	location: '/pirate/', // CHANGE THIS LOCATION TO REFLECT YOUR INSTALLATION
```

4. Include pirate! in your web project:
```html
	<script type="text/javascript" src="/pirate/pirate.js"></script>
```

5. Use it everywhere!

PLEASE HELP
--------------------------
I'm not the most dependable guy when it comes to writing documentation. 
I can write some fairly entertaining tutorials or articles about clever 
hacks, but straight documentation is generally my weak point. If anyone 
has a knack for this sort of thing and wants to become as famous as I am, 
please do something with my documentation. Fix it, redo it, destroy it, 
whatever. Just do something with it.

BUILD SOME SHIPS!
---------------------------
I know that there is not a clever online Harbor yet for people to submit 
Ships to yet, but there will be soon enough. Until then, please start 
making some ships. If I get Sam Stephenson's permission, I'll have a few 
more ( prototype.js bits ) to add to the Harbor, but for now I don't feel 
right doing it. I want our community ( which currently consists of just me ) 
to be filled with active Ship builders knocking out sweet Ships.

IF YOU NEED HELP 
---------------------------
Please don't hesitate to call the Ghostbusters. Or, if you can't find 
their number, you can email me and I'll do my best to explain just what 
the fsck is going on. If I can. Most of the time I don't really know what 
I'm doing, but I'll give it a shot. Your best bet is to have questions 
about comments in the code. I know a lot about comments. In JavaScript, 
you can make a comment with two slashes like this: //, or you can even 
make a big, sexy, multi-line comment like this: /* IM A COMMENT WOOT! */. 
See? I told you. I'm one of the leading experts on comments in the world. 
That's a fun fact you can use to impress your friends.

FRIEND: "I have the coolest library on the planet. It's called OpenRico 
and it was written by a pack of hyena's in the deserts of Africa."

YOU: "Oh yeah, well, my library is way cooler than yours. It's called 
pirate! and it was written by the worlds leading expert on code comment 
theory and best practices. Seriously, he is great with comments. It 
embarasses me to try to write comments now, because I know they're not 
as good as his."

FRIEND: "That's not so cool. With OpenRico, I get like, 26,000 lines of 
code in my browsers memory just to make a small request to a webpage to 
retrieve a picture of a ninja."

YOU: "Isn't that a bad thing?"

FRIEND: "No way dude. The more lines of code that are loaded into memory, 
the better the library is. It can do more things. Everyone knows that."

YOU: "What about people who have slower computers? Doesn't that cause problems?"

FRIEND: "Who cares about them. My site is so freaking cool that people 
are going to go and upgrade their computers so that they can read my 
blog. In the comments for my blog posts, I use the Rico Accordian 
widget to make it slide up and down. It's VERY cool. That feature took 
6804 lines of code. That's a LOT. I'm awesome."

YOU: "Wait a minute, did you just say you use Rico to get pictures of ninjas?"

FRIEND: "Oh yeah dude. Ninjas are totally sweet. Rico is all ABOUT the ninjas."

YOU: "Oh really mate?"

FRIEND: "Really!"

(do not try this stunt at home, ninjas deserve death. you do not)
YOU: *stabs FRIEND in the eye with a rapier* 

FRIEND: *DIES*
